        <h2>Add New Treasure</h2>
        <p>Know of another hiding spot and want to add your own treasure? Let me know (just to be clear, this is Thor at 10 Winslow). I'm currently trying to sneak in time to learn a fancy backend framework so that I can let you all create your own spots without me as the inbetween. I think everyone knows that finding free time isn't the easiest right now though so it will be a slow work in progress.</p>
