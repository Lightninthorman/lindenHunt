# lindenHunt
Neighborhood treasure hunt while we're stuck in coronavirus lockdown. Based on letterboxing.

There's a lot going on when nothing's going on as long as you have two little kids running around. In an attempt to keep us and our neighbors occupied I hid different stamps around the neighborhood and the surrounding woods and created this app to help the kids go on a treasure hunt.

When they choose which stamp they want to find then they get a set of step by step 'clues' to lead them to the hiding place. They collect the stamps in a notebook and leave the stamp itself behind.

I figured once they knew all the spots (currently only 6) then we'd be out of luck again so I created a challenge game. They draw a 3x3 grid on the page that matches the challenge board in the app. They select how many stamps they want to find and the app chooses random stamps and puts them in a random cell in the grid. The challenge is to see who can put the collect their stamps fastest and in the right location. Every time you click the generate button a new board setup comes up so each kid can have their own unique challenge. 

I am also trying to learn Laravel to create a backend that will save the boards and allow other people to add their own stamps, but that is more intense to learn than Vue so it is taking a lot longer. Considering this was created by sneaking off to watch a tutorial for a few minutes while the kids watched a show, or while trying to stay up after the kids have gone down, I'm pretty proud of the end result. I hope the neighbors enjoy.
